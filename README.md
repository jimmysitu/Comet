# Comet
RISC-V ISA based 32-bit processor written in C++ for High Level Synthesis (HLS).

## Pre-requisites
1. [RISC-V toolchain](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-tools)
2. [Catapult HLS](https://www.mentor.com/hls-lp/catapult-high-level-synthesis/)
3. [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Components of the project
Vivado HLS is used for FPGA IP synthesis and Catapult HLS is used for ASIC synthesis.

* Run `make` to generate the simulator `comet.sim`.
* To build it as an FPGA IP, run `script.tcl` in Vivado HLS. (not maintained)
* To synthesize it to rtl for ASIC, run [genCore.py](catapult/genCore.py) in `catapult` folder. See `genCore.py -h` for argument list.

## Documentation
The primary design goal behind using High Level Synthesis (HLS) is that for simulating the functionality on a host machine,
FPGA synthesis of ASIC synthesis the same C / C++ code can be used, with minimal changes. However since the target platforms,
and tools involved are different in nature, these differences have to be accounted for without having to re-write the major
functionality.

## Architecture
The 5 stage pipelined architecture currently has 64MB of instruction memory and 64MB of data memory. 32 bit
Arithmetic and logical integer operations are supported. We support M extension but the division and the modulo operation are external to the core because they take more than one cycle to execute at the synthesis.

## Simulator
In order to execute an elf file compiled by `riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc`, it is necessary to have a process which reads the
different sections of the binary file, extracts the program instructions and data, and stores it in the instruction and data
memory. The functions to handle the the elf file are in [elfFile.cpp](src/elfFile.cpp), [elf.h](include/elf.h) and
[elfFile.h](include/elfFile.h). The process which calls these functions, fills the memory and starts the execution of the
processor, is defined in [reformeddm_sim.cpp](src/reformeddm_sim.cpp).
To verify the simulator behavior, you can run a benchmark through it and check that the output is coherent with the [check.py](check.py) python script.

## Benchmarks
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/riscv/riscv-tools
export RISCV=/where/you/want/the/compilation/to/install
cd riscv-tools
./build-rv32ima.sh
export PATH=$PATH:$RISCV/bin
```
Now that you have compiled the compiler, you can compile the benchmarks:
```bash
cd benchmarks
make
```
After this, you can `./comet.sim -f benchmarks/build/matmul_int_4.riscv32` and this will run the benchmark through the simulator.

## Debug

You can compile with debug mode with `make debug` and this will enable all the debug output in the simulator. The output starts with a header that contains the cache parameters used in the simulation, then it presents the binary simulated followed by the address boundaries for each section in hexadecimal format.
```

filling data from 020948 to 021623

```

Next part is a dump of the instruction memory where first line is `instruction memory :` and next lines are `address : instruction` where both address and instruction are in hexadecimal format. Instruction is always 4 bytes wide. Next part is a dump of the data memory where first line is `data memory :` and next lines are `address : datum (value)`.  Address and datum are hexadecimal, while value is decimal representation of datum. Datum is 1 byte. Both dump (instruction & data) include only non zero data. Missing addresses are null instruction or data. At the end, the line `end of preambule` indicates that the dump is finished.

Following part is the dump of the pipeline information for each cycle. First line is WriteBack stage that is writing back instruction `@address instruction (numinstr)`. Second line is `cycle regid:regvalue` where only non null registers are printed. Register value is the value **AFTER** the writeback and in hexadecimal format. Then we have `Mem @address instruction`, `Ex @address instruction`, `Dc @address instruction`, `Ft @address instruction`. If the stage is empty(bubble), only the stage name is printed. If Mem is executing a store or a load, Ex, Dc and Ft may not be printed because they are locked. The number before Ft is the address of the next requested instruction. `i @address instruction set way` may follow Ft indicating that the instruction cache has the requested instruction. The instruction address before and after Ft may not match because of a jump for instance.

In case of a memory access, the dump will look like this :
```

i    @011a74   0007c783    3 1
```
After Mem, we have `d(R|W)size @address  memvalue formatted_data signextension   set way`, other stages are not printed because they are locked. For write, signextension will not be shown.
The dump may present other information such as external operation(DIV & REM) or some cache information (fetch/writeback).
At the end of the simulation, the line `Successfully executed 18050 instructions in 153793 cycles` should be present. Next is a dump of the data memory with the same format as the dump at the start of the simulation ended by `End of memory`. Then we have core statistics as well as cache statistics.

## Fault Injection

When the simulator is built with the \_\_FAULT_INJECTION\_\_ definition (`make faultInjection`), a binary called `cometFI.sim` is created. This binary supports a new set of arguments relative to fault injection.
The `-I <maxExecCycles> <injectionCycle> <coreLocation> <bitPosition>` switch enables the fault injection mechanisms.

All the arguments are needed :
  -  `maxExecCycles` : The maximum number of cycles the core is allowed to run the workload without being considered hanged.
  - `injectionCycle` : The cycle at which the injection will occur.
  - `coreLocation` : The register in which the injection will be performed, this argument is an integer that must be choosen using this table :

  |  # 	  |  Location 	| Width |
  |---	  |---	        |---	  |
  |  0 	  |  FToEx 	    |  97 	|
  |  1 	  |  DCToEx 	  |  174 	|
  |  2 	  |  ExToMem 	  |  126 	|
  |  3 	  |  MemToWB 	  |  115 	|
  |  4 	  |  PC 	      |  32 	|
  |  5 	  |  RF0 	      |  32 	|
  |  ... 	|  ... 	      |  ... 	|
  |  36 	|  RF31 	    |  32 	|
  |  37 	|  CoreCtrl 	|  205 	|

  - `bitPosition` : the flipflop position within the targetted register (please refer to  `core.h` to get the definition of each field). If the argument is greater than the width of the targetted register it's value is clipped so that the MSbit of the register is affected.

The fault injection compilation flag also enables the `-D <dumpFileName>` switch. It allows the creation of a file that contains a full binary dump of the system's data memory at the end of the execution.
